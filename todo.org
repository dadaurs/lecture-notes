CLOSED: [2023-04-13 Thu 10:27]
*** DONE page 117, how does this hold "by definition"
CLOSED: [2023-06-08 Thu 14:49]
** Blackbox/questions about stuff

*** DONE Prop 1.4 why is there a -1 in the end?
CLOSED: [2023-03-18 Sat 23:09]
We are taking relative proj, so the dimension drops...

*** Understand vanishing of H^q(F(X),O) on page 114 (probably due to serre duality, but how?)

** stuff
*** DONE Pushforward in cohomology via poincarre duality, prove push-pull formula
CLOSED: [2023-04-19 Wed 17:03]
*** TODO Add construction of fano variety of lines + computation of dimension
*** DONE include in part on fano variety diagram (7)
CLOSED: [2023-04-19 Wed 18:53]
*** TODO find reference for remark 19.1.11 fulton


** Soft Questions
*** in construction 2, suffices to check on fibers of universal bundle and know that image of L_t < P(V) lies inside V(F_i)
*** make distinction topological correspondence and algebraic correspondence?
*** projector onto prim coh? what's wrong?
*** Cayley-Hamilton, Leray-Hirsch, without hyphen?h;w
*** To see that sym is well-defined on K_0, have to use that taking \Sigma_n invariants on surjective morphisms remains injective -> use that C-vect spaces are uniquely divisible and thus their H^1 vanishes?
*** To see that the equality in K_0(Var_C) lifts to an iso, need to see that ses of _polarizable hs of weight n_ splits. Then use this degree wise and use that all hodgestructures appearing are levelwise polarizable
*** spectral sequence for cohomology of symmetric product, see notebook

* Topology Seminar Questions
** TODO Should talk about theorem 4? Maybe too technical for the talk
** TODO different definitions of Hopf algebra, I give the definition with antipode and show it is equivalent to the condition on comultiplication
** TODO grading on dual of vector space, why is there a -n?
** TODO I do everything with p\neq2, at the end mention result for p=2
