*** DONE Grassmanians definition in Vakil
CLOSED: [2023-03-14 Tue 15:04]
*** DONE Universal exact sequence of the grassmanian (wtf)
CLOSED: [2023-03-16 Thu 16:59]
*** TODO Flat schemes, Vakil (Maybe Hartshorne)
*** DONE Hilbert Scheme of Points/Hilbert Quot scheme (Geometry of schemes)
CLOSED: [2023-03-16 Thu 16:59]
*** TODO how an element in CH^1(X) determines an element in H^2(X,Z)
*** TODO Chern class (Eisenbud)
*** TODO Schubert class/cells (3264)
*** TODO deformation theory
*** TODO do exercise III.6.1
*** TODO WTF does "no obstructions to deform" mean?
*** TODO Diagram 1.15
*** TODO h^0(L, N_{L/X}) = 2n -4 implies F(X) has dimension 2n-4 intuitively, but reference?
*** DONE geometric intuition for lines of first/second type
CLOSED: [2023-03-21 Tue 19:02]
*** TODO What is H^2(F(X),Z)(1) -> tate twists??
*** TODO page 117, how does this hold "by definition"
** Blackbox/questions about stuff
*** Blackbox construction of Quot schemes?
*** Blackbox fact that families are flat iff they have constant hilbert pol?

*** DONE Prop 1.4 why is there a -1 in the end?
CLOSED: [2023-03-18 Sat 23:09]
We are taking relative proj, so the dimension drops...
*** TODO smoothness follows from what exactly? (Jacobian criterion does not apply in general)
*** Cor 1.14, how does H^1(L, N_{L/X}) =0 imply smoothness of F(X)? (This somehow relates to the chapter on the local theory, so read it...)
*** Maximal possible dimension of linear subspace of quadric surface inside P^{n+1} is \floor{n/2}
If more than n/2 linearly independent equations vanish on V(F), their product divides F...
*** Understand vanishing of H^q(F(X),O) on page 114 (probably due to serre duality, but how?)
