\section*{1}
We show the double implication.\\
First, suppose there exists $s\in A$ such that $ s^{2}= b^{2}- 4ac$.\\
Since $\gcd( a,b,c) =1$, the polynomial $ax^{2}+bx + c$ is primitive and we may apply Gauss's lemma which states that $ax^{2}+bx+c$ is irreducible in $A[x]$  if and only if it is irreducible in $ K[x]$.\\
Note that, in $K[x]$, we may write
\begin{align*}
	a ( x- \frac{-b+s}{2a}) ( x- \frac{-b-s}{2a}) &=a\left(  x^{2} - \frac{-b-s}{2a}x - \frac{-b+s}{2a} x + \frac{( -b+s) ( -b-s) }{4a^{2}} \right)\\
&= ax^{2} + bx + a \frac{b^{2}-s^{2}}{4a^{2}} \\
&= ax^{2} + bx + c
\end{align*}
Hence, $ax^{2}+bx+c$ is not irreducible in $K[x]$ and thus also not in $A[x]$.\\

Now suppose $ ax^{2}+bx + c$ is not irreducible in $A[x] $, then it is also not irreducible in $ K[x]$ by Gauss's lemma ( as $ ax^{2}+ bx +c$ is primitive by hypothesis ) .\\
We now use the fact that a polynomial of degree two over a field is not irreducible if and only if it's zero set is non-empty (example 3.4.7.4 from the course notes).\\
Thus, rewrite ( in $K[x]$ ) 
\begin{align*}
ax^{2} + bx + c &= a ( x^{2}+ \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a}) \\
&= a \left[ ( x+ \frac{b}{2a})^{2}  - \frac{b^{2}}{4a^{2}}+ \frac{c}{a} \right] \\
&= a \left[ ( x+ \frac{b}{2a}) ^{2} - \frac{b^{2}- 4ac}{4a^{2}} \right] 
\end{align*}
Thus, if 
\[ 
a \left[ ( x+ \frac{b}{2a}) ^{2} - \frac{b^{2}-4ac}{4a^{2}} \right] =0
\]
Then, there exists $ \frac{s'}{d'}\in K[x], s',d' \in A[x]$ such that
\[ 
 ( \frac{s'}{d'} + \frac{b}{2a}) ^{2} - \frac{b^{2}-4ac}{4a^{2}} = 0
\]
In particular, define $ s=  s'2a + bd' $ then we have that 
\[ 
\frac{s^{2}}{4a^{2}d'^{2}}= \frac{b^{2}-4ac}{4a^{2}}\iff \frac{s^{2}}{d'^{2}} = b^{2}-4ac
\]
Thus $ \frac{s^{2}}{d^{2}}= \left( \frac{s}{d}\right) ^{2}$ is an element of $A$  satisfying the condition.
\section*{2}
\subsection*{a)}
We view $ x^{2}+ yx + 1$ as an element of $ ( \mathbb{C}[y] ) [ x] $ and use the criteria established above.\\
Indeed, $ x^{2}+ yx +1$ is primitive as a polynomial over $ \mathbb{C}[y]$ as $ \gcd( 1, y,1) = 1$.\\
Furthermore, $ y^{2}-4$ (the discrimant $ b^{2}-4ac$ of the polynomial)  may be rewritten as $ ( y-2) ( y+2) $, and we claim that there does not exist a polynomial $f$ such that $ f^{2}= ( y-2) ( y+2) $.\\
Indeed, this would mean that $ \deg f = 1$, but then $f$ is linear and thus has exactly one 0, however $f^{2}$ has two zero's, a contradiction.\\
Hence, the polynomial is irreducible.
\subsection*{b)}
Simply write
\[ 
y^{2}x^{2} + yx^{2} + yx + y^{2} = y ( yx^{2} + x^{2} + x + y) 
\]
Thus, the polynomial is not irreducible.
\subsection*{c)}
We use the same trick as in a) and consider it as a polynomial over $ \mathbb{C}[y]$.\\
Hence the discrimant is $ y^{2}-4y^{2}= -3y^{2}$ which is the square of $ \sqrt{3} i y$.\\
Thus, we may write (this formula follows from our general computations in part 1) 
\[ 
	(x - \frac{- y - \sqrt{3} i y}{2}) ( x- \frac{-y + \sqrt{3} i y}{2}) = x^{2} + yx + y^{2}.
\]
