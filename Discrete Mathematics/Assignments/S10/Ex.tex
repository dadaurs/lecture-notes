\maketitle
First, note that we can suppose that $G$ is not a tree, and thus contains a cycle.\\
Indeed, if $G$ is a tree, it's spanning tree is $G$, and hence $E( G) \setminus E( T) = \emptyset$.\\
Thus, suppose that $G$ is a graph with at least one cycle.\\
We will now show that, if $e \in E( G) \setminus E( T) $, then $e$ is contained in a cycle of $G$.\\
For the sake of contradiction, suppose that $e= \left\{ a,b \right\} $ \footnote { $a,b \in V$}  is not contained in a cycle.\\
Then there exists $c \in V$ such that there only is one path $ v_0, \ldots, v_k$ such that $v_0=a, v_k= c$.\\
Since the spanning tree contains $c$ as a vertice, we deduce that the spanning tree must contain $a$ as a vertex.\\
\hr
Hence, choose an edge $e' \in E( T) $ of the form $ \left\{ a,d \right\} $ and which is contained in the same cycle as $e$, hence $e'$ is not a leaf.\\
Remove $e'$ and add $e$ from $T$, note that the resulting graph is still a tree since we have not added any cycles and that it still contains all the edges of $G$ since $b$ is not a leaf ( it is contained in a cycle).
