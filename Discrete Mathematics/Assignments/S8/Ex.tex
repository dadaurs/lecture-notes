\maketitle
We prove the result by induction on $n$.\\
The case $n=1$ is clear, indeed, by definition, a vertex of degree $1$ is a leaf, so the whole graph contains at least one leaf.\\
Let $G= ( V ,E) $ be the tree we consider.\\
Suppose the result shown for $n > 1$ vertices, we now show it for $n+1$ vertices.\\
Let $\mathcal{V}$ be the vertex of degree $n+1$.\\
Let $ \left\{ e_1= \left\{ \mathcal{V},v_1 \right\}  , \ldots,e_{n+1} = \left\{ \mathcal{V}, v_{n+1}  \right\}   \right\} $ be all the edges of $G$ which are connected to $ \mathcal{V}$. \\
Now consider the set of all paths starting at $v_{n+1} $ and which do not pass through $ \mathcal{V}$, we denote this set by $P$.\\
We can now consider the set of all edges which are contained in a path of $P$, ie. we consider 
\[ 
\mathcal{E} = \left\{ \left\{ a,b \right\} \in E | \exists \left\{ c_1, \ldots, c_{k}  \right\}\in P\quad \exists i : c_{i} =a, c_{i+1} =b   \right\} 
\]
and we let
\[ 
V' = \left\{ a \in V | \exists e \in \mathcal{E} \text{ such that } a \in e \right\} 
.\]

We can now consider the graph $G' = (  V\setminus V', E \setminus ( \mathcal{E} \cup \left\{ \mathcal{V}, v_{n+1}  \right\} ) )$.\\
Note that $\mathcal{V}$ now is of degree $n$, so by induction hypothesis, $G'$ has at least $n$ leaves.\\
However, we can now consider the path of maximum length in $P$, the last element of this path is a leaf, since if it wasn't a leaf, we could extend the path.\\
This leaf, however, is not contained in $G'$, which means that $G$ has at least $n+1$ leaves.\
This concludes the proof by induction.
