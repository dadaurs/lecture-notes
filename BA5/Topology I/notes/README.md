As some people on whatsapp asked, here are my notes for the 2022 course Topology I given by Viktoryia Ozornova in Bonn.

I tend to not rewrite/rework my course notes and only use them as vague support material, so they are (or will be) almost certainly full of typos and mistakes.
If you see obvious mistakes, feel free to create an issue here or message me on whatsapp.

Hope somebody finds this useful :)
