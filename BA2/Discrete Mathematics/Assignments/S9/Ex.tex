\title{Exercise 9}
\author{David Wiedemann}
\maketitle
As shown in the course, to each unlabeled tree $T$ with $n$ vertices, we can associate a ( not necessarily unique)  sequence $S \in \left\{ 1,-1 \right\} ^{2n-2}$.\footnote { We simply substituted $+$ with $1$ and $-$ with $-1$.} \\
$T$ can then be uniquely reconstructed from this sequence.\\
Let us show that any sequence in $ S$ corresponding to such a tree satisfies 
\[ 
	\sum_{i=1}^{ k} S_i \geq 0 \quad \forall 1 \leq  k \leq 2n-2
\]
and 
\[ 
	\sum_{i=1}^{ 2n-2} S_i = 0 
.\]

First, notice that the second equality follows immediatly from the way we define the contouring path of an unlabelled tree.\\
\hr
To show that $\sum_{i=1}^{ k} S_i \geq 0 $, we use induction.\\
For $k=1$, it does not make sense to reduce the distance to the root vertex, so $S_1>0$.\\
Suppose shown for  $1 \leq k < 2n-2$, we will now show the result for $k+1$.\\
If $ \sum_{i=1}^{ k}S_i >0$, then $S_{k+1} $ can take any value and the result will still hold.\\
If $ \sum_{i=1}^{ k}S_i =0$, the distance to the root vertex is 0 and hence it is impossible to further reduce the distance to the root node, this implies that $S_{k+1} =1$, which concludes the proof.\\
\hr
As shown in the fourth exercise sheet, the number of sequences satisfying these properties is given by $b_{n-1} $.\\
Since there is a surjection from the set of such sequences to the set of unlabelled graphs, we deduce that
 \[ 
b_{n-1} \geq T^{n}.
\]
