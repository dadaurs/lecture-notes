Yes, since you can consider

False, consider $$Q\subset R$$ and enumerate
$$ cl(\bigcup_{q\in Q} \{q\} ) = R$$ but $$\bigcup_{q\in Q} cl (q) = Q$$

*** Question 2 week 10 ask for counterexamples given in class
In a metric space, we used that around any $x\in \partial A$, we can find nested subsets $B(x,1/n)$ which always intersect $A$ and so we can construct a sequence converging to x.
This doesnt work in a topological space since we cant always find such a family of open nested subsets
*** Question 6 week 4 ask discord
This is still true, since we can consider the composition $f\circ \gamma$, now if $Im f\circ \gamma= \{0,1\}$, then clearly it must be constant, if the image contains the whole set however, we may consider $(f\circ\gamma)^{-1}(\{0,1\})$
and $(f\circ\gamma)^{-1}(\{2\})$ which must be disjoint and thus form an open partition of $[0,1]$, which is connected
*** Question 12 week 4
Yes there is, suppose there isn't, consider an interval $(a,b)$ on which $f$ is polynomial with $p$, note this interval can never be maximal since $f$ is polynomial around b and thus $p_b$ and $p_b$ and $p$
agree on an open set, implying they are actually equal.
*** Question 1 week 5
It is connected since any open set contains an infinite amount of elements.
Consider a path $\gamma: [0,1] \to N$ going from a to b, then $\gamma^{-1}( a^c)$ is open and contains 1, similarly $\gamma^{-1}(b^c)$ is open and contains 0, finally $\gamma^-1(\{a,b\}^c)$ is open and contains neither 0 nor 1, and hence we've formed a partition of [0,1], which is absurdjk;w
*** Question 6 week 5 review solution without hyp cl(A) connected
actually, $A$ connected implies $cl(A)$ is connected, hence the proof stays the same.
To show $B$ is connected, simply consider a partition $U\cup V= B$, now note that this implies (wlog) that $U \subset A$ and hence $V \subset cl(A)$, but any open set around $\partial A$ always intersects A, which is absurd
*** Question 1.2 week 8
It is bounded (obv) and is closed as the graph of a cts function.
*** Question 6 week 8
The sets $S(a,b)$ are closed since their complements can be written as $\bigcup_{i < a} S(i,b)$.
$\{-1,1\}$ is closed since it's complement can be written as $\bigcup_p S(0,p)$
If there was a finite amount of prime numbers, their intersection would also be a closed set and so $\{-1,1\}$ would open, which is impossible
*** Question 4 week 9
We can take the discrete and the euclidean metric and the last one is kinda broken
*** Question 4 week 10 ask 
*** Question 10 week 13
*** Question 3 week 14
Seems meagre since $\sum(a_i+\epsilon)(b_i+\epsilon)$ will diverge
