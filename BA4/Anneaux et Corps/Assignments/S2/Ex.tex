\section*{1}
Indeed, let $\frac{a}{b}\in \mathbb{Q}$ in reduced form such that $\nu_p(\frac{a}{b} )=0 $. By the definition of $p$-adic valuation, this means that we may suppose both $a$ and $b$ share no common factors with $p$, then $\frac{b}{a}$ also shares no common factor with $p$ and hence $\nu_p( \frac{b}{a}) =0$, implying $ \frac{b}{a}\in R_\nu$.\\
Finally, $\frac{a}{b}\cdot \frac{b}{a}= \frac{1}{1}$ which finally implies that $\frac{a}{b}$ is invertible in $R_\nu$.
\section*{2}
First we show that all $( p^{n}) $ are distinct ideals of $ R$, indeed suppose there exists $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $ ( p^{a}) = ( p^{b} )$, without loss of generality suppose $a<b$.\\
Hence, there exists an element $ \frac{x}{y} \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $ \nu_p( \frac{x}{y} ) \geq 0$ such that $ \frac{x}{y}p^{b} = p^{a} $.\\
As $ \mathbb{Q}$ is a field, this implies that $ \frac{x}{y}= p^{a-b}$ which means $ \frac{x}{y}$ has a negative valuation which contradicts our hypothesis.\\

Now we show that the ideals mentionned in the exercise are indeed all the ideals of $ R$.\\
Let $I$ be an non-zero ideal of $ R$.\\
Define $ a = \inf_{x \in I\setminus \left\{ 0 \right\} 	} \left\{ \nu( x)  \right\} $. Since $\nu\vert_{I \setminus \left\{ 0 \right\} }  $ has codomain $ \mathbb{N}$, this infimum exists and is attained by some element $y \in I$.\\
Note that we may write $ y = p^{a} \frac{d}{c}$ where $d$ and $c$ are coprime to $p$.\\
By part $1$, we know that $\frac{d}{c}$ is invertible, hence implying that ( since $I$ is an ideal) $p^{a}\in I$.\\

We pretend that $ I = ( p^{a}) $, to do this, we show the double inclusion.\\
First, note that, since by construction $ p^{a}\in I$, we immediatly get that $ ( p^{a}) \subset I$ since $( p^{a}) $ is the smallest ideal containing $ p^{a}$.\\
Furthermore, let $x \in I$, then by definition of $a$, $\nu( x) \geq a$.\\
We may then write $x = p^{\nu( x) }\frac{d}{c} = p^{a} p^{\nu( x) -a}\frac{d}{c}$ where $d$ and $c$ are coprime to $p$, this implies that $x\in ( p^{a}) $.\\
Hence, if $I$ is a  non-zero ideal, $I$ is of the form $p^{n}$ for some $n$ and since these ideals are disjoint, we have characterised all of them.
\section*{3}
Using the exercise of week 2, we know that $ \mathbb{Z} \subset R$.\\
Hence consider the composition $ \mathbb{Z} \xhookrightarrow{\iota} R \xmapsto{q_R} \faktor { R} { ( p^{n}) } $ where $\iota$ is the inclusion morphism and $q_R$ is the canonical projection morphism.\\
Furthermore define $ q: \mathbb{Z}\to \faktor { \mathbb{Z}} { ( p^{n}) } $ to be the canonical projection.\\
We now pretend that $\ker ( q_R\circ \iota) = \ker q = ( p^{n}) $.\\

Indeed if $ a \in \ker q = ( p^{n}) $, then $p^{n}| a$ hence $p^{n}| \iota( a) \implies q_R(\iota ( a )) = 0$.\\

Similarly, now suppose $r\in \ker ( q_R\circ\iota) $, this means that $\iota( r) \in \ker q_R = ( p^{n}) $ (where now $( p^{n}) \subset R$).\\
Hence there exists $ \frac{a}{b}\in R$ (where we suppose $ \gcd( a,b) = 1 $ without loss of generality) such that $ p^{n} \frac{a}{b}= \iota( r) $.\\
Now, since $\frac{a}{b}\in R$, $\nu( \frac{a}{b}) \geq 0$ which implies in particular that $b$ is coprime to $p$.\\
Hence, since $\iota( r) $ is an integer, $ \frac{a}{b}$ has to be an integer which implies $b=1$.\\
Thus $ p^{n}a = \iota( r) \implies p^{n}a = r $  (in $ \mathbb{Z}$), ie. $ r \in ( p^{n}) \subset \mathbb{Z}$.

Hence applying the universal property of the quotient ring, we get an induced morphism as such:
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{\mathbb{Z}} & {\faktor{R}{(p^n)}} \\
	{\faktor{\mathbb{Z}}{(p^n)}}
	\arrow["{q_R\circ\iota}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["q"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow["{\exists !\varphi}"', dotted, from=2-1, to=1-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]
We pretend that it is now sufficient to show that $q_R \circ\iota$ is surjective to show that $\phi$ is indeed an isomorphism.\\
Before showing that $q_R \circ\iota$ is surjective, we show how this implies $\phi$ is an isomorphism.\\
Indeed, if $ q_R\circ \iota$ is surjective, then
\[ 
\faktor { R} { ( p^{n}) } \simeq \im q_R \circ\iota \underbrace{\simeq}_{ \text{ by first isom. theorem } } \faktor { \mathbb{Z}} { \ker q_R \circ\iota } \underbrace{\simeq}_{ \text{ since } \ker q_r\circ\iota = ( p^{n}) } \faktor { \mathbb{Z}} { ( p^{n}) } 
\]\\



We now show that $q_R \circ \iota$ is surjective.\\
Let $ \left[ p^{i}\frac{a}{b} \right]\in \faktor { R} { ( p^{n}) }  $, where, again, we assume $\frac{a}{b}$ is in reduced form and shares no factors with $p$.\\
To show this, we must find an integer $d \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that 
\[ 
\frac{a}{b}p^{i}- d = k p^{n}, \quad k \in R 
\]
where by abuse of notation, we regard $d$ as included in $ R$.\\
Indeed, then $ q_R( \frac{a}{b}p^{i} )= q_R( d) $ which will imply that $q_R \circ \iota$ is surjective.\\
Using that $p^{n}$ and $b$ are coprime, choose $x$ and $d$ integers such that $xp^{n}+ db= ap^{i}$, such $x$ and $d$ always exist because of Bezout's theorem.\\
Now set $k= \frac{x}{b}$, note that $k \in R$ since $b$ is coprime to $p$.\\
It is now immediatly verified that 
\[ 
\frac{a}{b}p^{i}-d = kp^{n}
\]
Since
\[ 
ap^{i}= kp^{n} b + db = xp^{n} + db 
\]
Hence $\frac{a}{b}p^{i}$ has a representative in $ \mathbb{Z}$ which in turn implies that $q_R \circ\iota$ is surjective, concluding our proof.
\section*{4}
To show this, we proceed by contradiction.\\
So suppose there exist two different prime numbers $p\neq q$ such that $R_p\simeq R_q$.\\
Note that an isomorphism of rings induces a bijection between the set of ideals which respects inclusion.\\
To declutter this proof, I prove this at the end of the document.\\
So let $\psi: R_p\to R_q$ be the isomorphism we assume to exist, using part 2, we know that all ideals of $R_p$ are of the form $( p^{n}) $.\\
Furthermore, we notice that these ideals are nicely ordered:
\[ 
	( p) \supsetneq ( p^{2}) \supsetneq \ldots 
\]
Applying $\phi$ to this chain yields a chain of ideals in $ R_q$ 
\[ 
	\phi( ( p )) \supsetneq \phi( (  p^{2} )) \supsetneq \ldots
\]
Using the result cited above, this immediatly implies that $\psi( ( p^{i}) ) = ( q^{i})  $.\\
In particular, $ ( p) $ is a maximal ideal and $\phi$ takes maximal ideals to maximal ideals, hence we get that $\phi( p) = ( q) $ .\\
Since $R_p$ and $R_q$ are supposed isomorphic, we would need to have that $ \faktor { R_p} { ( p) } \simeq \faktor { R_q} { ( q) } $ are isomorphic.\\
Indeed, consider $q_q\circ\psi: R_p\to \faktor{R_q}{( q) }$ the composition of the isomorphism with the canonical quotient map and $q_p: R_p \to \faktor{R_p}{( p) }$ since $( p) = \psi^{-1}( ( q) ) $ and $q_q\circ\psi$ is surjective, we conclude by the first isomorphism theorem that $\faktor { R_p}{( q) } \simeq \faktor { R_q} { ( q) }  $.\\
Using part 3, this would imply that $ \faktor { \mathbb{Z}} { ( q) }\simeq \faktor { \mathbb{Z}} { ( p) } $ which is a contradiction, since they are not even in bijection as sets.\\

We now show the result cited at the beginning of part 4.\\
So let $ \phi: A \to B $ be an isomorphism of rings and let $I \subset A$ be an ideal, then $\phi( I) $ is an ideal since:
\begin{itemize}
\item Clearly $\phi( I) $ is an additive subgroup since $\phi( 0) = 0 \in \phi( I) $ and $\phi( a) + \phi( b) = \phi( a+b) \in\phi( I) $.
\item Let $\lambda\in B$ and $\phi( a) \in \phi( I) $, then $ \lambda\phi( a) = \phi( \phi^{-1}( \lambda) ) \phi( a) = \phi( \underbrace{\phi^{-1}( \lambda) a}_{\in I	})\in \phi( I)$. 
\end{itemize}
This correspondence is clearly a bijection between the ideals of $A$ and $B$ since $\phi$ is a bijection and the correspondence obviously preserves inclusions since maps of set preserve inclusions.\\
In particular, if $\mathrm{m} $ is a maximal ideal, then $\phi( \mathrm{m} ) $ is maximal since if $B \supsetneq J \supsetneq \phi( \mathrm{m}) $, then $A \supsetneq\phi^{-1}( J) \supsetneq \mathrm{m}$.
